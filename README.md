# PantheonLootParser

This program can parse your Chat window in Pantheon: Rise of the fallen game and after recognizing text, search Shalazam site for items been looted by you, or your groupmates, and then add description of items to Clipboard, so you can add description in game chat.
To make things work:
1. Start program
2. Select your character if it is not selected (program needs to get in-game chat window position settings)
3. Start Pantheon: Rise of the fallen game
4. Press Ctrl + Shift + V on your keyboard when you or groupmates loot something and you want to recognize items from chat.
5. When all jobs will be done you will hear sound, so you know that information can be pasted to chat.

There is mode, when program will type information in group chat, but it will works only if the cursor not in the chat-window when you pressing hot-key.

Program will cache items descriptions for a week, so it will not get information twice for one item.

P.S. Recognition will work better if the chat window is not translucent. If so, you can hover over the chat window to make it solid colors.
